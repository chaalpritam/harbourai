# Harbour AI Agent

An AI-powered platform that simplifies transforming web3 communities into Social DAOs by automating onchain creation, proposal management, voting, and treasury operations. It integrates AI tools for drafting proposals, analyzing governance, and providing real-time insights, all while bridging social platforms with blockchain execution. Designed to democratize DAO adoption, it empowers communities to self-govern transparently, turning decentralized collaboration into seamless, onchain action.

## Agent Functionalities

- Create ERC20 Token
- Send Transaction
- Check Balance

- Create DAO Token
- Create DAO Governor
- Create Target Contract
- Create Timelock

## Hackathon Tracks

***$10,000: Smart Account Tooling: Humans X AI***

Sponsored by Safe

Add an AI Agent as a co-signer to perform advanced security checks before approving transactions.

Hard requirements: The Agent does security checks on the Safe transaction using the decided transaction metadata. It signs (and probably executes) the transaction if the security checks pass.
