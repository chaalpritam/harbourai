- Check Balance
- Show Wallet Address
- Create DAO Token
- Create DAO Governor
- Create Target Contract
- Create Timelock

## Hackathon Tracks

***$10,000: Smart Account Tooling: Humans X AI***

Sponsored by Safe

Add an AI Agent as a co-signer to perform advanced security checks before approving transactions.

Hard requirements: The Agent does security checks on the Safe transaction using the decided transaction metadata. It signs (and probably executes) the transaction if the security checks pass.

***$10,000: Smart Account Tooling: Best Use of Lit Agent Wallet with Safe smart accounts***

Sponsored by Lit Protocol

[Resources:](https://developer.litprotocol.com/agent-wallet/intro)

***$7,500: Smart Account Tooling for Agents - Build an AI application or agent that leverages EigenLayer or an EigenLayer AVS***

Sponsored by Eigen Layer

Examples: implementing verifiable inference, verifiable agent, AI model governance system, AI agent reputation system, or anything else you can imagine

[Resources:](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/)

***$10,000: AI Advancement - Best Cross-Chain Interoperability Agent***

Sponsored by Optimism

Recognizes the agent demonstrating advanced cross-chain capabilities, securely managing assets across multiple blockchains.

Hard Requirements:

[Uses SuperchainERC20s token implementation here](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/interop/superchain-erc20)

[Deployed on at least two Superchain Network list here:](https://www.superchain.eco/superchain-index)

[Resources:](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/interop/explainer)

***$10,000: AI Advancement: Rust/Stylus Agent***

Sponsored by Arbitrum

Hard Requirement: Your agent must be built using Rust or interacts with Stylus contracts

***$5,000: AI Advancement - Enhance your agent with onchain read/write capabilities and decentralised storage. Use it in combination with all other tracks***

Sponsored by Fileverse:

ü§ñOut of the box, the SDK provides each agent with a:

-A Safe Smart Account, ERC 4337: gasless transactions, make your Agent customizable

-Smart Contract on Gnosis: public & permissionless registry of all the agent‚Äôs outputs

-Storage space on IPFS: decentralised and content addressing focused for your agent‚Äôs outputs

-Human-readable .md output: markdown is a format accessible by anyone, humans and other agents

üë©‚ÄçüíªWith the SDK your agent can:

-Publish data onchain & on IPFS
-Read/retrieve onchain and IPFS data from any agent
-Manage identity: sign/execute transactions autonomously
-Collaborate onchain: index, query, share all their outputs between agents & more

This track encourages you to combine these features with other tracks to create powerful, self-sovereign, and fully autonomous agents.

## Interesting Ideas

Agent-Safe Bridge: A connector or service layer that translates AI commands into Safe-compatible calls, allowing agents to initiate or sign transactions reliably.

SDKs & APIs: Developer-friendly libraries that streamline how AI agents interact with Safe smart contracts, so teams can easily plug in AI-driven logic.
